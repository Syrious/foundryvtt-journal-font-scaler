# CODE-ONLY REPO
This repository is only meant to host the code. All new releases can be found [on my hub](https://hub.adventurer-backpack.com/module/journal-font-scaler)

# FoundryVTT Journal-Scaler
Based on [Journal Scaler](https://github.com/jegasus/journal-scaler), which hasn't been updated since Foundry v9.
I reworked it to make it compatible with v10, v11 and v12.

### What is does
This module enables you to change the font and image sizes inside journal windows using `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Up` and `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Down`.

In the settings, you can choose whether you want to always scale images or only scale them when you are holding both `Ctrl + Shift`.

Please note that it doesnâ€™t remember the scaling settings when you close the entry, and the images and font sizes do not scale exactly the same way.
### Installation and setup
This module requires [ruipin's libWrapper library](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper).

## Acknowledgements
### Original Journal Scaler
This module is based on [Journal Scaler](https://github.com/jegasus/journal-scaler). Thanks for the earlier versions. Hope, you're doing well.

### ruipin's libWrapper
This module uses [ruipin's libWrapper library](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper). Take a look at his stuff if you want to develop modules for FVTT that override its default behaviors.
