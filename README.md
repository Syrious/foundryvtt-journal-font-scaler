# FoundryVTT Journal-Font-Scaler
Based on [Journal Scaler](https://github.com/jegasus/journal-scaler), which hasn't been updated since Foundry v9.
I extracted the text scaling parts and reworked it to make it compatible with v10 and v11 (both tested).

### What is does
This module enables you to change the font sizes inside journal windows using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+`mouseWheelUp` and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+`mouseWheelDown`.
It doesn't remember the scaling settings when you close the enty. 

### Installation and setup
This module requires [ruipin's libWrapper library](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper).

## Acknowledgements
### Original Journal Scaler
This module is based on [Journal Scaler](https://github.com/jegasus/journal-scaler). Thanks for the earlier versions. Hope, you're doing well.

### ruipin's libWrapper
This module uses [ruipin's libWrapper library](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper). Take a look at his stuff if you want to develop modules for FVTT that override its default behaviors.
